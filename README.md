# Mobile Flashcards
[Google Play Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.rembcard.exp)

An mobile application made with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for simplifying the process of individual studying by ebabling the user to break everything he has learned so far into decks of flashcards. The use of flashcards for studying is widely recognized as one of the most efficient methods for memorization. Test yourself by checking what you have learned and take a quiz on a regular basis. The simplified design stimulates concentration.

## Running the app
To install the application for testing right away, you need to:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm run web`, `npm run android` if you have an android emulator, `npm run ios` if you have an ios simulator

## Storing data
The decks and glashcards are stored using [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage.html) and the process of handling the data is implemented using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Built with
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) and [Expo](https://expo.io/). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app).
